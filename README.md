# Land-Rover
This project is created during the coursework in Robotics and Electronics with CEAC University. The Lunar Rover tries to navigate autonomously interacting with the different sensors (bumpers, ultrasonic) while it's receving commands through IR that triggers an specific command where it needs to behave in an specific way.
